Flight Controller for Ryze/DJI Tello Drone in C# / Dotnet 8. 
Based on Tello 3.0 Protocol.

This is a rewrite of my Tello API for the 2.0 protocol: [github.com/marklauter/TelloAPI-SDK-2.0](https://github.com/marklauter/TelloAPI-SDK-2.0).

## Developer Notes
### 11 MAY 2024
- created project
- I aim to provide a set of Nuget packages
- original project was overly complicated because I was using it as a test for some C# techniques
- I aim to simplify this version
- will be interesting to see if I've learned anything in the last 6 years.
